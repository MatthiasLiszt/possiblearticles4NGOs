## So how to get funded 

Twelve stars a blue background and everyone minds its own business. Hmm..., and within this “Union” there is probably you with the people you know and your dreams of becoming a web developer. 

Maybe you still remember the days the Euro was introduced and you looked at the notes and said “Cool! We got the money from the monopoly game.” and decades after you are just used to it. 

As for funding Europe still has provincial laws and state laws and by joining the EU we just got one law more. However official stayed the same as the languages used and we just got one pot more to get money from. 

In case you are still the rabbit who says “Good Night!” to the fox nearby, there is no fault in doing so. There is no need to go straight to Brussels or Jean-Claude's residence in Luxembourg and ask for funding. 

Stay where you are and you soon will realize you probably have been like a fish asking another fish “Have you heard about this thing called 'water' ?”.  

However you should socialize in your home town or city and talk with people , 
be active in social networks and get at least acquaintaned with people who got funded. And with funding I mean “every kind of funding”. It is not that the EU and government are funding. Companies or foundations(“Stiftungen”) are also a great way to start. Even participating in some competition or contest (“Wettbewerb”) where the winner can win some funding is a great way to start with. 

Well, so how to start ? I'd say legalize and register. In case you live in the bureaucratic Central European countries, it is probably easier to found an association (“Verein”) and register at the local police. At least in a small country like Austria that is easily done. 

However in other countries it might be easier or more beneficial to found a Limited or UG (“Unternehmergesellschaft”) which has the advantage that you are allowed to make profit. 

There are many reason why you should register or legalize and found your own association , although there's already one in your country. You showed interest, you did something, you probably got donations and managed money and encouraged people to do so do and in sum you together with others managed to get more money from the pots. 

No need to emphasize that once your association or juridical person is founded it should appear in public as often as possible. People come together and talk and that is where you can get the information you need to get the funding you want.

The other thing is cooperation with existing companies or institutions. Something which should not be underestimated. It is said the hippo likes to have its teeth cleaned by small birds. 

Being present at exhibitions, conferences etc. and finding a way to support existing companies and institutions might be the key for your association to get well-funded too. 

By the way there is actually one word on all Euro-banknotes that is probably unintended Russian. It's “BCE” and means “all” or “too much”.
